# movielens-project-edx

This EdX project defines a linear regression machine learning model that will predict the rating of a given movie. The model will be created with the 10M MovieLens dataset. Due to the size of this dataset, an approximation of a linear effects model will be used to reduce the algorithm run-time. The userId and movieId predictors consistently had the highest impact on the RMSE of the model. The selected predictors for the linear regression model are userId, movieId, movie_year and genres. The RMSE of the selected model is 0.86475 when tested on the edx_test dataset, and 0.86516 when tested on the validation dataset. The equation of the linear effects model is Y = μ+x_u +x_i +x_g +x_my , and a tuning parameter λ = 4.5 is used to regularize each predictor. The main limitation of this project is the usage of an approximation of the linear model.
